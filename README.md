# org-metrics

## I. Overview
This project focuses on building a user-friendly tool that automates the creation of visually appealing and customizable GitHub organizational profiles, rendered entirely in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format.

## II. Target Users
This tool empowers GitHub organizations to streamline the creation of their profiles.

## III. Key Features
Export the following information as SVG to embed in the README file for data visualization.
1. Base content, the following sections are supported:
    - `header`: which usually contains organization name and a few additional data.
    - `community`: which contains community stats (following, sponsors, etc.).
    - `repositories`: which contains repository stats (license, forks, stars, etc.).

    These are all enabled by default, but it is possible to explicitly opt out from them.

2. Programming languages used by organization members.
3. Stargazers evolution across affiliated repositories (total stargazers, new stargazers per day).
4. Coding habits based on recent activity, such as active hours and languages recently used.
5. Ratio of open/closed issues and the ratio of open/merged pull requests across repositories.
6. Recent activity on GitHub. Events types are fetched from [GitHub events API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/github-event-types) and the following types are currently supported:
